# Analysis of Tanpura Tunings

This project explores the tuning systems of the Tanpura, a classical Indian instrument, using signal processing techniques in Python. The objective is to identify the tuning of a 4-stringed Tanpura and the key of the tuning through analysis of recorded audio samples.

## Key Features

- Analyzes Tanpura tunings using spectrograms, chromagrams, and energy distributions.
- Applies techniques like Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) and Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) to extract audio features.
- Identifies tuning keys using band-pass filtering, median filtering, and global thresholding.
